# Contributing

Thanks for helping keep this list useful. Corrections are as welcome as additions — a fixed
description or a removed dead link is worth as much as a new category.

## What qualifies

A category is a good fit when most of these are true:

- It answers a question people actually arrive with, in the words they use.
- At least a handful of distinct products would sit in it, from different makers.
- It is a kind of work, not a kind of customer and not a kind of technology.
- There is enough public information to describe it accurately.
- It covers something the existing entries in that category do not.

We will not list:

- Broken, parked, or login-walled sites with no public information.
- Products that have shut down or been folded into something else.
- Affiliate landing pages, coupon sites, and lead-capture funnels.
- Near-identical clones with no meaningful difference.
- Anything whose main activity is clearly illegal, or NSFW-focused products.
- Anything submitted purely as a promotional exercise.
- A third level. Two is the whole design; a third produces nodes with one
  member and a judgement call on every new tool.
- Categories named after a single product or vendor.
- Industry verticals. A tool sold to hospitals is still a transcription tool.
- Marketing phrases with no settled meaning, however often they appear on
  homepages.
- Spelling and abbreviation variants of a node that already exists. Those are
  aliases, and adding one to the right node is a genuinely useful contribution.

## Two ways to contribute

### Open an issue

Fastest option, and fine if you would rather not touch Markdown.

- [Suggest a category](../../issues/new?template=suggest-a-category.yml)
- [Report a broken link](../../issues/new?template=report-a-broken-link.yml)

### Open a pull request

Edit `README.md` directly and open a pull request. One logical change per pull request:
one category added, or one category corrected, or one batch of dead links removed.
Mixed pull requests take much longer to review and are usually sent back.

## Entry format

Every entry follows the same shape:

```md
- **[Category Name](https://example.com/)** — What it does, in one sentence. `Freemium` `Web`
```

Rules:

1. **Link to the official website.** Not a review page, not a directory listing, not a
   referral or affiliate link, not a URL shortener. HTTPS, and the canonical form — no
   tracking parameters, no `?utm_...`, no trailing junk.
2. **Name it the way its own site does.** Not the SEO title, not "Name AI Best Free
   Generator".
3. **Description: 8 to 25 words, 35 at the absolute most.** One sentence. Say
   what it does and who would use it.
4. **Write it yourself.** Do not paste the vendor's tagline or their homepage hero copy.
5. **No superlatives.** No "leading", "revolutionary", "best-in-class", "game-changing",
   "cutting-edge". No claims about user counts, funding, or awards.
6. **Pricing labels are fixed.** Use only `Free`, `Freemium`, `Paid`, `Open Source`,
   `Free Trial`. Up to two per entry. No dollar amounts — they go stale too fast.
7. **Platform labels are optional.** Use only where they are genuinely useful and you are
   sure: `Web`, `Windows`, `macOS`, `Linux`, `iOS`, `Android`, `API`, `CLI`,
   `Browser Extension`, `VS Code`, `JetBrains`, `Discord`. If you are guessing, leave it out.
8. **Alphabetical order within the category.** Ignore punctuation and a leading "The".
   Insert in the right place rather than appending to the end.
9. **One category per category.** Pick the primary use case. Cross-listing the same
   entry in several categories is what makes these lists unreadable.
10. **Do not add a TiorAI link to your entry.** A minority of entries end with a link to a
    TiorAI alternatives, comparison, or round-up page. Those are maintainer-placed, capped
    at a quarter of entries, and chosen where readers are likely to want that specific
    follow-up. Pull requests that add more will be asked to remove them.

### A worked example

```md
meeting-assistants,Meeting assistants,productivity-and-workflow,2,"Recording, transcribing, and summarising meetings.",meeting notes,,2026-08-21
```

## Before you open the pull request

- Search the README for the name **and** the domain. Renames and acquisitions mean the same
  product can already be listed under a different name.
- Open the URL in a private window and confirm it loads without a redirect chain.
- Check the pricing label against the vendor's own pricing page.
- Confirm your entry is in the right alphabetical position.

## Disclose any relationship

If you work for the company, founded it, invested in it, or are being paid to submit it, say
so in the issue or the pull request description. This is not disqualifying and it will not
count against you. Undisclosed promotion that we find later gets the entry removed.

## What happens next

Maintainers review every submission and keep final editorial control. Descriptions are often
edited for length and consistency before merging — that is normal, not a criticism of your
writing.

Submitting a category does not guarantee it will be listed. It can be declined
because the category is already well covered, because we could not verify enough about it,
or simply because we did not think it earned a slot. We will say which, and there is no
appeal process beyond a polite argument in the thread.
