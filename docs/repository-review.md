# Repository and pattern review

What was looked at before building this list, and what was taken from it. No editorial

One decision is specific to this repository and worth recording.

The top level is not original. It is the same twenty categories the TiorAI AI tools dataset
already publishes, and that was a deliberate constraint rather than a shortcut. A taxonomy
repository that invented a twenty-first arrangement would have put two TiorAI repositories in
public disagreement about how AI tools divide up, and a reader would have no way to tell which
one to believe. Fixing the top level meant the work went into the second level, which is where
a directory actually needs help.

The cost is real and worth stating: the top level inherits whatever is wrong with the dataset's
categories. `Health and lifestyle` is a wide bucket, and `Business and finance` covers work that
has little in common beyond being nobody else's. Both would probably be split if the tree were
being designed from nothing.

## What was adopted

**One entry format, without exception.** Every entry takes the same shape:

```text
- **[Name](https://example.com/)** — What it does, in one sentence. `Freemium` `Web`
```

Deviation is what makes a list unscannable and unparseable, and it costs more than it appears
to.

**A contents block that maps one-to-one onto the headings.** Every `##` section appears in
it, every anchor resolves, and the block fits on one screen.

**Per-entry metadata from a closed vocabulary.** Pricing and platform labels mean the same
thing here as in every other TiorAI repository, so they can be relied on rather than read.

**An explicit review date.** Most lists in this space carry no freshness signal at all, so a
reader cannot distinguish a list reviewed last week from one abandoned two years ago.

**A written selection policy.** What qualifies, what does not, how entries are ordered, and a
plain statement that there is no paid placement, sponsorship, or affiliate link.

## What was deliberately not adopted

**Size as a selling point.** Several lists in this space advertise their entry count. A list
nobody can finish reading has not curated anything, and the counts are usually inflated by
dead links nobody has checked.

**Year-branded naming.** `awesome-<topic>-2026` reads as current for a few months and as
abandoned forever afterwards.

**The Awesome badge.** It signifies acceptance into the official Awesome index. This
repository has not been submitted, so displaying it would be a false claim.

**Deep hierarchy.** No `###` subcategories inside the list body. That is the point at which
these lists stop being navigable.

**Emoji as meaning.** Decorative only at best, and inaccessible at worst.
